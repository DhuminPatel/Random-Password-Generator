# Random-Password-Generator
A beginner level python project that generates a random password.
The program asks the user to input a number between 10 and 20. The input represents the amount of characters the password will have.
The password contains a combination of letters (upper and lower), numbers, and special characters. 
The user can request for a new password for as long as they want.
